            Hello! My name is Nikko Bustillo. I started out as a medical student following the footsteps of my mother.
            After a while,
            I decided for myself that the medical field was not for me. I decided to pursue a different passion and a
            different
            drive that would make me happy. While working as a rehab aide technician, I learned how to push and submit
            electronically
            signed doctor documents into a cloud. That made me wonder how that system worked and what syntax makes it
            run.
            It brought me back That lead me to remembering building website profiles on MySpace that dealt with code.
            At
            that moment, I wanted to make that passion into a job that I would be happy with. I was extremely glad and
            fortunate
            that Rutgers had a program that could take my passion and drive to the next level.
